plone.future.login
==================

New login process for Plone without needing portal_skins

This is just a placeholder for now. Code work will start soon. I am planning a sprint in Bristol, UK in the near future (July 2013).

TODO
====

* Document and produce flowchart of current login process
* Research 'best practice' of login process currently
  - Every website in the world already logs users in, can we do better than we do now?
  - Surely there must be documented 'best way' to do this, taking into account JS and mobile devices etc.
* Tests!
* Documentation!
* Code!
